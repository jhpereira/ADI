    "* The cell in the bottom left corner (cell `29`) is adjacent, to the left, to the cell in the bottom right corner (cell `35`). In other words, if Pacman \"moves left\" in cell `29` it will end up in cell `35` and vice-versa.\n",
    "* If Pacman lies in the same cell as the ghost (in either cell `1`, `2`, or `3`), the player loses the game. However, if Pacman \"eats\" the blue pellet (in cell `24`), it gains the ability to \"eat\" the ghost. In this case, if Pacman lies in the same cell as the ghost, it \"eats\" the ghost and wins the game. Assume that Pacman can never be in cell `24` without \"eating\" the pellet.\n",
    "* Pacman is unable to see the ghost unless if it stands in the same position as the ghost (however, it does know its own position and whether it ate the pellet or not).\n",
